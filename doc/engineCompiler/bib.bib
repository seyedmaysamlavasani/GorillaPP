@InProceedings{ReSim,
   abstract    = {Abstract Å‚è†è¥ Modern processors are becoming more complex
                 and as features and application size increase, their
                 evaluation is becoming more time-consuming. To date,
                 design space exploration relies on extensive use of
                 software simulation that when highly accurate is slow. In
                 this paper we propose ReSim, a parameterizable ILP
                 processor simulation acceleration engine based on
                 reconfigurable hardware. We describe ReSimÅ‚è†èπs trace-driven
                 microarchitecture that allows us to simulate the
                 operation of a complex ILP processor in a cycle serial
                 fashion, aiming to simplify implementation complexity and
                 to boost operating frequency. Being trace driven, ReSim
                 can simulate timing in an almost ISA independent fashion,
                 and supports all SimpleScalar ISAs, i.e. PISA, Alpha,
                 etc. We implemented ReSim for the latest Xilinx devices.
                 In our experiments with a 4-way superscalar processor
                 ReSim achieves a simulation throughput of up to 28MIPS,
                 and offers more than a factor of 5x improvement over the
                 best reported ILP processor hardware simulators.},

                 parallelism to keep functional units busy. Compiler

                 Message-passing on the other hand is good for programs

                 enough for algorithmic development. The model proposed,
                 called LogP includes 4 parameters: (a) L: an upper
                 bound on the message latency. (b) o: overhead of
                 sending or receving a message (not both). (c) g:
                 minimum gap between consecutive message sends or
                 message receives. (L/g) defines an upper bound on the
                 max number of messages outstanding between any fixed
                 pair of nodes. This puts a bound on capacity of
                 network. (1/g) is the per-processor communication
                 bandwidth. (d) P: the number of processor/memoery
                 modules. The paper also showns algorithm for FFT and LU
                 decomp, including mapping which I find interesting.

  abstract =     "Previous studies of bus-based shared-memory
                 multiprocessors have shown hybrid
                 write-invalidate/write-update snooping protocols to be
                 incapable of providing consistent performance
                 improvements over write-invalidate protocols. In this
                 paper, we analyze the deficiencies of hybrid snooping
                 protocols under release consistency, and show how these
                 deficiencies can be dramatically reduced by using write
                 caches and read snarfing. Our performance evaluation is
                 based on program-driven simulation and a set of five
                 scientific applications with different sharing
                 behaviors including migratory sharing as well as
                 producer-consumer sharing. We show that a hybrid
                 protocol, extended with write caches as well as read
                 snarfing, manages to reduce the number of coherence
                 misses by between 83% and 95% as compared to a
                 write-invalidate protocol for all five applications in
                 this study. In addition, the number of bus transactions
                 is reduced by between 36% and 60% for four of the
                 applications and by 9% for the fifth application.
                 Because of the small implementation cost of the hybrid
                 protocol and the two extensions, we believe that this
                 combination is an effective approach to boost the
                 performance of bus-based multiprocessors.",
